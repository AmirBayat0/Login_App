I worked on this project during highschool, in The first semester of university. Since, I wasn't familier with versioning systems, Hence, there is no past history of code
The code is written in pathetic manner, it lacks modularity, comments, test-cases, documentation, schema backup etc but another fact is during that period for me it was an example of good code ;)

I implemented this simple project as a Basic For Android language exercise!
You can upload this project on your system, use it or extend it.
I say Again, this is a simple and practical project!
And it has a lot of bugs, in the future I will complete this program and turn it into a real application.
